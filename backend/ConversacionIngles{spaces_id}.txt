Polkadot:  Hello everyone. Just give us another minute or two to get all the speakers added and then we will begin.
Polkadot:  All right, everyone, welcome to the November community call. All of our speakers are almost all of our speakers, excuse me, have joined us. We have a loaded.
KevinKNeilson:  We can hear you. Yeah, you're good.
hello_melikhov:  We.
Polkadot:  I just heard that no one can hear me. Is there? Can anyone confirm? Oh, you can hear me. OK, OK, wonderful. Great. So we have a packed agenda for agenda for us here today.
Polkadot:  To kick us off we will have Raul and at the polka dot Council member give a high level update of all the major referenda and motions and governance proposals we've had this past month on both networks for both polka dot and Kusama. We we will have Darwinia joining us today to talk about their first light client based E substrate cross chain asset bridge. We will have equilibrium joining us here today.
Polkadot:  To talk about their closed beta and what's next for equilibrium, we have Origin trail on the call with us today to talk about their project magnify. We have turn joining us to talk about light clients and the future of trustless bridging. So definitely you see a pattern here with light clients and bridging today we have an Ambassador Zoe joining us here today to talk about the polka dot events bounty and how you can use it and we have.
nachortti:  
Polkadot:  Frost and Moonbeam joining us together to talk about their axiom integration and the derivatives they're launching on Moonbeam. So or actually on Moonbeam, Moonbeam and Bifrost, excuse me. So without further ado, since we have such a jam packed agenda, let's kick it off with Rahul. I also want to remind everyone here in the lower right hand corner since the agenda will be packed today, there won't be time at the end probably to take questions. So if you have.
Polkadot:  Questions while the speakers are speaking, do hit this box or purple circle thing on the lower right hand corner and put your questions there and I will be checking as speakers are talking and make sure to ask your questions before they leave the stage, so to speak. So without further ado, let's hand it over to Raul.
nachortti:  Hi everyone, I hope you can hear me OK.
nachortti:  Yes.
Polkadot:  Yes, we can hear you.
zoemcfox:  Yes.
nachortti:  Because I was having some issues. I'm sorry. So good day to everyone. I hope you're having a good day. I'm here to give you the latest changes on proposals on both Kusama and Polka dot network. As always, I will start by Kusama then move to Polkadot and I will divide each network on governance proposals and treasury proposals. So let's start with Kusama first. On Kusama we have quite the month because referendum 244 which was already executed.
nachortti:  Upgraded the runtime, the network runtime, to version 9320. This upgrade included open governance, which is the new model for governance that we're experimenting with on Kusama before moving on to Polkadot. And there's still some adjustments to be done, especially on some of the parameters for each of the tracks that the community can now propose proposals on and both simultaneously, and some other adjustments.
nachortti:  Regarding some issues with migrations, particularly with two ex with two approved proposals that came from as a legacy from governance 11 from Genshiro, one from Kintsugi, which the Council will be voted on soon to make sure that they get executed as the Community wanted. But other than that, open governance seems to be working quite nicely and we need to adjust some things, so congratulations to everyone who participated.
nachortti:  And the referendum 244 boat.
nachortti:  On other news, there is a there is some updates on the statement COLLATORS set up. Motion 577 which was executed reduce the Collators managed by the statement team from four to two and increase the public collators from 4 to 8. And then a follow up motion motion 580 which was also executed also further increased the statement public collators from 8 to 12. So this means that.
nachortti:  Now public collators can also participate on the state my network collation referendum 243 which was also executed extended encounters common good list for a 48 more weeks. So congratulations to the team for that and thank you to the Community for voting in this particular proposal regarding treasury proposals on kosama motion 573, which was also approved by the Council.
nachortti:  Funded the development of CUSA Mint. Cusa Mint is a development kit for NFTR artists, collection makers and the Kusama community in general. It provides different tools to mint and manage NFT's with ease. So congratulations to the team and we're looking forward to the first deliverables and how to use them. There's also an external motion that was approved by the Council and will be put up for vote by the Community soon as a legacy of governance.
nachortti:  One, this is the Treasury proposal 227 for Kagome C++ implementation, the Kagome C++.
nachortti:  Implementation aims at the team aims to to cover the first milestone development of Kagome, which is a polka dot host greeting in SIM plus plus and developed by Sora Mitsu. It will be up for a vote by the community soon on the democracy tab under the governance one model since it's an external cue, so we will announce it on the direction channel so the Community can vote for the normal period of time on Kusama. The goal of the proposal is to complete the client integration on the pole Karan Kusa
nachortti:  That will make us validating nodes. So we're looking forward to that boat as well. And then as the last one on Treasury proposals on Kusama, we're excited to say that referendum #1, which is the first Treasury proposal up for vote on the open governance model is now up for both by the Community. This is a Treasury proposal for the Snow Bridge funding development. Snow Bridge is a a fully trustless, permissionless and general purpose bridge between.
nachortti:  Some polka dot and etherium the rich will launch as we know on the bridge have a common good para chain that is being developed by parity and this proposal is a funding request for 28 months worth of the long term runway for all operations. For the Snow Bridge team, the full proposal can be reviewed on the post. We're going to share all of these links also on Twitter, but you can also find the links and the discussions in the direction channel or in the governance forums as well.
nachortti:  Let's move to Polkadot Polkadot. We have also quite a few governance proposals, the first one being referendum 81 which was executed by executed, approved and executed by the community. The referendum 81 includes Polkadot collectives common good para chain proposal on a lease on polka dot network. So now the collective common good chain is up and running and building blocks and the first two the 1st.
nachortti:  The collective that we will see happening on the collective spirit and will probably be the Polkadot alliance which you will be able to find the links also in the tweets once we provide all of the information. But you can also find the discussion on poke assembly and eventually I think the fellowship will also migrate to to polka dot ones. This is ready and regarding the the next proposals and referendum 78.
nachortti:  Was also passed and executed. This is the first Polkadot nomination pool initial configuration. The initial configuration for this nomination polls that were added on POLKADOT includes the following one dot to join a pool, 200 dots to create a pool, and a maximum of 64 pools and 16,000 members in all polls. So we're very excited about this new feature that the staking team has been.
nachortti:  Working on for quite some time, so super excited for more small token holders to join and participate in the shared security of the network related to the new configuration of nomination polls. There was a second proposal that was voted as that is being voted as referendum 86 and it will be up for vote for the next 20 days. This proposal tries to increase the minimum nomination limits for.
nachortti:  Uh, nominators. In order to prevent too many waiting nominators to be created and incentivize small nominators to move to nomination polls, you can still vote on this proposal. It's up for a vote right now on Polkadot for the next 20 days as a referendum #86 and then a motion to 191 was also passed by the Council. This was not voted by the community as it was not necessary for the Community to vote the Council.
nachortti:  Voted on this one and this includes a proposal for open permissionless Collado registration and statement. So this includes public collators on statement in the same way as they are included on statement. Following on our experience in Kusama network regarding Treasury proposals, we have three that I want to point out and make sure that everyone knows about them. The first one is referendum 77, which was passed.
nachortti:  As we know for the gossamer ongoing development grant, we've been talking about this in the other Community calls when the proposal was up for discussion. Gossamer is a polka dot host greeting lingo, and it's a framework to build and run nose for different blockchain protocols compatible with the polka dot ecosystem. And the overall goal is to provide the functionality needed to bring true client diversity to the polka dot ecosystem. So this particular contextual information can be seen also in 
nachortti:  Has referendum 77 already passed by the community? Then we have motion 298 that is also up for both and related to the Snow Bridge proposal that is on Kusama as well. Although the Snow Bridge proposal on Kusama is an open Gov model, meaning that the community is already voting on it on polka dot, we still have governance one model. This means that this proposal, given their requested allocation, is up for vote by the Council as an external motion.
nachortti:  And then we'll be boarded by the community if the Council approves. This is the portion of the Snow Bridge proposal that needs to be funded by the Polkadot Treasury. A portion of it will be funded by the Kusama Treasury and a portion by Polka dot Network. And the third one I want to point out as a Treasury proposal that is interest interesting to the Community and pass this week is Motion 296 already passed by the Council and executed. This is a proposal for ink design.
nachortti:  Audit by open settling open settling has developed a deep expertise and set industry standards for secure smart contract development in the past, and this is their first proposal on the polka dot network. This Community proposal because it involves open settling but also several teams in the polka dot ecosystem including a star big country, open brush pendulum network, falla network, water and others. This proposal aims to audit and review the current design.
nachortti:  The Ink smart contract language together with substrate mark contracts valid to recommend actions to be taken and improve the development experience and security of ink language. So All in all, those are the proposals that I'd like to point out to the Community. We're going to be sharing all of the links for the Open Golf model. We will also be sharing a link for your suggestions and request a of changes in the Opengov model so we can discuss them and eventually open the discussion and vote for 
DarwiniaAMAs:  
Polkadot:  Thank you, Raul. And as Rahul mentioned, I know that was a lot and a bunch of links and a bunch of information really fast. So after this Twitter space tomorrow, we typically tweet out a tweet thread with all of these relevant links to all of these proposals. So if you heard something and you wonder where is that located or what's the link, we will be posting that tomorrow. So without further ado, up next we have Darwinia network to talk about their first light client based.
DarwiniaAMAs:  
Polkadot:  Ethereum 2.0 substrate, cross chain message route and Bridge Asset Bridge.
DarwiniaAMAs:  So that's a bit of a handful I guess, um, GM and GM everyone. I hope you're having a great day or evening wherever you are. For those of you who aren't aware, Darwinia is a programmable cross chain message network and one of only a few number of substrate native projects working on trustless light client based bridges between polka dot and external networks. And it's a super exciting time for trustless bridges in the ecosystem, especially as we get closer to the launch of the BV finality gadget 
DarwiniaAMAs:  Rachel, further decentralize things and uh in the meantime, at Darwinia we've recently deployed the first light client based Etherium 2.0 to substrate route and Helix Bridge has incorporated it for use between Etherium and Darwinian network for a select few assets. Next, we're going to be extending the route for use with power chains and projects we've opened channels with which will allow developers on those chains to call smart contracts on Ethereum using Axiom and vice versa using Darwinian a
DarwiniaAMAs:  SDK which will allow developers to address simple, simple endpoints from a single smart contract deployment. Overall interest in trusses, bridges and interoperability and our integration queue is growing fast these days, so if you need to incorporate functionality or assets from external chains and security is a primary consideration, definitely feel free to reach out for more info.
DarwiniaAMAs:  
Polkadot:  Great. Thank you so much. Is that it on your side, Megan?
Polkadot:  
DarwiniaAMAs:  That's all the updates we have for now. Thank you.
Polkadot:  OK, wonderful. Well then let's hand it over to equilibrium to talk about they just recently closed beta and let's hear what's next for equilibrium.
hello_melikhov:  Yeah. Thanks very much. Thanks very much for having me here. I'm super excited to join today's call and share some perspective on our road map, what we doing, it's equilibrium and what we have accomplished just recently. You mentioned the closed beta, we had great success with that. But firstly, before I go into details of all these things, let me briefly introduce myself, give you some context in what we're exactly building in the Dotsam ecosystem. So my name is Alex, I'm the CEO and the founde
hello_melikhov:  It's, uh, equilibrium. I'm engineered by mathematics but training and I'm actually in crypto since.
hello_melikhov:  For quite a long period of time since 2016. We've been working on equilibrium since 2020. So it's been 2.5 years almost of extensive building. And the idea behind equilibrium is the building the comprehensive D5 platform, which includes a bunch of functionality starting from.
hello_melikhov:  The like little functions with working with the ecosystem tokens and.
hello_melikhov:  Actually, like it's one of the most the broadest, I guess functionality that we have across D5.
hello_melikhov:  Platforms in the, in the in the markets overall, so.
hello_melikhov:  Recently we have conducted the closed beta launch and we we actually been, we have our own parachin slot that we have got back in the days and in April and it's been a long journey for us to roll out our developments into real production. So recently I was actually in October we will we were conducting the closed beta launch for for limited group of users.
hello_melikhov:  Uh, but uh, the activity that we have seen was really impressive. We have.
hello_melikhov:  First of all, we have launched the subscription for closed beta participation and we have received over 10,000 applications. Out of this 10,000 applicants, we have chosen roughly 4048 hundreds of users who were accepted for the closed beats and we have seen quite significant activity around our products that have been running for the closed pizza. The idea of the closed pizza was to.
hello_melikhov:  Lets people play with the virtual tokens on our side. So so they got. They received like everyone who stayed in the closed beats they received.
hello_melikhov:  Um, certain kind of amounts of these virtual assets and they needed to play with these assets in the course of the closed beta, obviously. So it was completely risk free. And there was also a team competition. So we have got so 23 teams participating in that. All the teams were kind of other representing certain communityinthe.com ecosystem or ecosystem projects. It was super, super interesting to see.
hello_melikhov:  Our guys were competing for like rewards that we were putting out in terms of these closed beta launch, given that.
hello_melikhov:  You know we have seen that's.
hello_melikhov:  CBT around our closed launch, we're expecting that we'll actually replicate this success in terms of our full scale launch, which will expectedly happen in the first half of this. So right now we are extensively preparing for that. And yeah, so if you're interested in our developments, you can actually visit our website, it's equilibrium dot IO. There we have all the links to soft pools where you can see like.
hello_melikhov:  So their announcements and our production launch, we're super excited about that. Again, it was a long journey. Just recently we have in terms of preparations for this production launch, we have also integrated with the multi chain bridge which is connected to us through Moonbeam. This is really important development for us because we can smoothly and almost.
hello_melikhov:  Kind of. In decentralized we transfer assets from other blockchains into equilibrium and.
hello_melikhov:  Uh, what's also importance on our side we have we will be opening axiom connections with all the operation projects we have partnership relations with, including Moonbeam Astar.
hello_melikhov:  And um, insulate and many others. So eventually we'll be establishing like exempt transfers across the polka dot ecosystem and eventually integrating all this kind of.
hello_melikhov:  Essence that we get through this transfers into our products that we are rolling out.
hello_melikhov:  Yes. So I guess pretty much from my side. Thank you very much for having me.
hello_melikhov:  
Polkadot:  Wonderful. Thanks, Alex. And up next we have Origin Trail to talk about project magnify.
DrevZiga:  Hello from our side this time it's two people from Origin trail, both myself, giga and stomach from from origin trail as founders.
DrevZiga:  It's it's pleasure to be here I believe this is one of our first calls within within the Polkadot Polkadot Band and it's it's it's great to be here and share exciting updates about about Origin Trail just a little bit about the origin trail for those who don't know us we are an ecosystem dedicated to making global economy at large work sustainably by organizing humanity's most important assets and we deal extensively with the issue of of trust in in supply chains.
DrevZiga:  Trust generally in in global economy and trust essentially has two enemies it's bad character and also bad data or bad information. And as you have seen and witnessed right now with all these FDX debacles and and similar things and also within supply chains and global economy, we cannot eliminate the bad character but what we can tackle is essentially bad information. We can tackle bad data and this is this is something that origin trail is taking the.
DrevZiga:  That app and what we're essentially doing and how we're dealing with the problem of bad data is by harnessing the power of decentralized knowledge graph. And the centralized knowledge graph is a merge between two technologies, blockchain on one side and also the knowledge graph technology which is being used by the likes of Google to connect information, to organize information and make it discoverable, verifiable and valuable. So we took both elements and what we do, we bring supply chain.
DrevZiga:  Of documents, consumer goods, information, digital collectibles, whatever asset and we bring it on the decentralized knowledge graph, making it discoverable, verifiable as Web 3 assets and thus driving transparency and trust. And we've been around for a while now. Origin Trail as a Web 3 project has been up and running for for five years, and we're especially glad and proud to be able to.
DrevZiga:  Deploying our origin trail on on polka dot. It was previously deployed on several other chains but right now it has gotten its own origin trail specific chain, its own parrot chain. It has been live since since summer and right now not only we're launching 11 network this year which is which is Origin Trail para chain, but also the second network which is the decentralized Knowledge Graph V6.
DrevZiga:  And the decentralized Knowledge Graph V6 is going to primarily use polka dot to bring quite important traffic from global supply chains where we have been traditionally involved. One such example is, is a group of retailers from the US you might know some of them like Walmart, JCPenney, Costco, So what they have been using Origin Trail for, they were exchanging information about all the three reports on several actually.
DrevZiga:  And dozens of thousands of factories importing to the United States. So traffic like like this, assets like like those are going to transition from from other chains where origin trail has been based on up until recently, 2V6 which is primarily going to launch on on Polkadot and also launching on OT, para, chain on polka dot and effectively on on the DKG on the decentralized knowledge graph is a project magnified. Now what project magnified does it allows for?
DrevZiga:  Visualization of all the assets of all the information that has been created on the decentralized knowledge graph and it's very easy to use. Anybody can use it, not only companies that we have traditionally been working with. And you're all welcome to join our telegram or or discord and see what has been achieved so far. It's an entirely community driven project project magnify and it will essentially go live from from the.
DrevZiga:  Beta version in which it is currently on the fully fledged public launch sometimes in the in the beginning of of January and another exciting thing which is going to precede that and it's it's mostly I think the the Community of Origin 12 is eagerly waiting waiting for that is the V6 launch which which for which we are within this and the next week waiting for to to certainly determine the determine.
DrevZiga:  Then in December we can you know have have have this happy event of releasing the beast called the DGV 6 on on the polka dot. I would now invite to Marsh to add a few things about the origin trail in general or the project magnify. It was really lovely to to talk with you and we're glad to continue this conversation in one of our channels whenever you feel eager to join.
DrevZiga:  
TomazOT:  Yeah, I think you I think you did it did a great job already covering most of the topics. So not much left for me to accept it to say hi to everyone and then again maybe extend the invitation really with with project magnifier especially it's something that that's very much a collaborative effort currently it it, it is within the the closed beta group of the Origin Trail community that are already creating.
TomazOT:  Assets on the on on the current test net version of O V6 which will then transition to the main net and they're already creating value for the network as well as value for themselves. And as a project it's really directed towards the values of the core values of web three of trust of ownership and it introduces certain other business models to what we were used to so far within the tech industry so.
TomazOT:  Yeah like the the website for Project magnify will be project magnify dot IO so you can go there and check it out and hope to see you hope to bump into you into our in our discord or telegram. So yeah that's thanks thanks for today.
Polkadot:  Wonderful. Thank you. And if you guys haven't noticed yet, at the top of the screen here, for each speaker, we're penning the relevant tweets or links. So if anything is of interest to you or you're wanting to follow the project or learn more, you can just simply click on the tweet here and you won't even leave the community call and you can give them a follow you can.
Polkadot:  Like the tweet? You can read it For more information. So up next we also have a turn to talk about light clients in the future of trustless bridging.
Maciej_Baj:  Hi, everyone. Likely from time here. Yeah, thank you so much for having us today. Seems like we were fitting in perfectly in today's theme talking about like clients.
Maciej_Baj:  One is all about drinking interoperable execution with the first aspect to it and on our way to provide the.
Maciej_Baj:  Ohh, discharging this platform for multi chain execution, we've been developing and experimenting bunch with light clients and while doing so we also discovered that essentially we can just bring light clients on chain.
Maciej_Baj:  Distance a little bit into opposition to what we see currently, where light currents are usually the ocean agents are primarily because the computation on Chinese is very expensive on material also.
Maciej_Baj:  Clients need to store a significant amount of storage information and on most of the most of the blockchains there's also quite expensive. Also there's different signature schemes on different blockchain and usually while developing smart contracts you only have the cheap way of verifying a single signature scheme, but in substrate assuming that.
Maciej_Baj:  We already paid for a parking slot. The the storage is cheap.
Maciej_Baj:  And.
Maciej_Baj:  Really nothing stands on the way of bringing all the lines going on chain and this is what we've been developing and experimenting for now. For now we have a light client that is operating on Grandpa, but we've been also investigating and started all experiments with the kaspari ETHERIUM 2.0 light clients. And also in substrate we can just implement and easily access multiple different signature schemes. So snorkel.
Maciej_Baj:  Or different parts trains at workers for etherium like blockchains and CSA for Bitcoin like Bitcoin like projects. So this was just a sneak peek. There's gonna be a kind of more detailed rundown throughout bringing on the live clients on chain.
Maciej_Baj:  On our talk on sub zero, which if you have a chance to join at least one.
Maciej_Baj:  Yeah, it would be lovely to to see you guys in catch up, catch up in person.
Maciej_Baj:  Also little updates to.
Maciej_Baj:  To our turn testers on the Coco who finally put the.
Maciej_Baj:  Local parroting of turn back on track.
Maciej_Baj:  It got stuck the last week on the last runtime upgrade, but luckily we passed all of the all of the necessary issues and the update on the Rococo it was bringing bidding for the smart contracts and the first of execution. So essentially this last feature that we added, it goes hand in hand in the very much so like open.
Maciej_Baj:  System for first of execution when we provide the system where open executors can bid for the cheapest possible execution.
Maciej_Baj:  Of of transactions to the remote blockchains.
Maciej_Baj:  Uh.
Maciej_Baj:  So yeah, super happy to to join today's call and possibly look forward to see you guys and.
Maciej_Baj:  Hear from you on Sub zero event. Thank you.
Polkadot:  Wonderful. Thank you. Up next, we have Zoe to talk about the Polkadot events bounty.
zoemcfox:  Hello everyone. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I will now going from deep tech in tomorrow again like a governance talk here. I'm Zoe, I'm global head ambassador of events for the polka dot network and one of three Co radars for the events bounty which I would like to shortly introduce you to today to give you a bit of a background how this bounty was created. The events bounty got initiated within division of decentralizing the.
zoemcfox:  Dot Council, which means to actually create initiatives that focus on specific areas or have more expertise in specific areas. And as some of you guys also noticed or realized that there was a big increase of event submissions to the Treasury to request funding and to have also the Council deciding on what kind of events should be funded from the Treasury and this big workload or this was a big workload.
zoemcfox:  What a Council itself and also a challenge because it was sometimes difficult for the Council to decide what kind of events are actually valuable to the Community and which are beneficial for the overall popular brand. And this was the initial thought about creating, let's say, a smaller council, a council or a group that has more expertise in the events for the POLKADOT community. And this is how the events bounty got actually initiated.
zoemcfox:  We have. It is a community events reward bounty with child bounty distribution. This is also very special because it's the second bounty that is actually using the child bounty mechanism in the popular ecosystem besides the anti scam bound team.
zoemcfox:  And this bounty is life now since our active since three months we have received 1,000,000 dot and we have 3 curators in this events bound team which are on one inside LED. She's community manager of Web 3 foundation and she also leads the overall Polkadot ambassador program. So she's very close in knowing what kind of events and meetups are initiated or hosted by Poco dot ambassadors. And then there's.
zoemcfox:  Mark was also a global head ambassador for the overall events in Polkadot as well. Myself and Mark and I are leading these kind of events for the popular community. So we have besides the Council a bit of a better insight on what kind of events are beneficial to the Community and also know what kind of requirements should be actually met to execute and host successful events that overall represent the Polkadot brand and expand the Polkadot brand to everyone that wants to know about it.
zoemcfox:  We have three different categories. I don't want to go into this, to uh, into detail, but overall we are supporting on one hand side all ambassadors, people that have an ambassador status and they want to host meetups and smaller get togethers and we also have category.
zoemcfox:  At category that covers bigger events such as conferences, hackathons or side events. And these kind of events can be organised by any Community member, someone that has a relationship to Polkadot, even Powertrain team members. So we have created a process that makes it much easier for or let's say Lena for the for the people to actually apply for funding. But it doesn't mean that we have less requirements. So we are still pretty strict in seeing what kind of requirements this event.
zoemcfox:  That meat to actually be supported in funding from in, in dot and from the Treasury. So over there to just give you a bit of overview here, over the last three months we have funded over 20 events which is a combination of bit of conferences as well as meetups and side events also now for sub zero that's coming up, there were a lot of submissions to fund these kind of of side events and we have also public page where you can actually look into this but if you would like to learn.
zoemcfox:  More about how this bounty works, how you as a powertrain team member, as a popular ambassador or just the active community member can request funding and rewards for doing activities such as events for the ecosystem. I would encourage you to join our crowdcast event which we are hosting on the 8th of December. It will be hosted on Polka dots official crowdcast platform and in this session we are going much more into detail how this whole bounce bounce.
zoemcfox:  Mechanism is working from a technical perspective but also to give you more insights on how you can actually go through the process to get funding for events. But we also cover other child boundaries such as the anti scam bounty and moderation bounty. So thank you so much and I look forward to see a lot of you guys on crowdcast and answer more of your questions there.
Polkadot:  Thank you so much Zoe, and again yes, if you guys have more questions, make sure to attend that crowd cast on December 8th on polka dots crowdcast. So last but certainly, certainly not least, we have a by frost and Moonbeam here to talk about their XCM integration.
KevinKNeilson:  High for us. Do you want to kick it off?
bifrost_finance:  Yep, no problem. Thanks.
bifrost_finance:  Greetings everyone, and this is Tyrone from Bifrost. I'm the product manager of Bifrost and we're very happy to be here today.
bifrost_finance:  Both was actually originally focusing on the building of cross chain staking Syrios and the liquid utilization for staking their options.
bifrost_finance:  And Martha's is actually deployed on Polkadot and Kusama para chain, but it actually running the same architecture, native token and business model. So which will be merged to one power share by using substrate common bridge in the future and which is also the direction that we are presently evaluating and researching about it and.
bifrost_finance:  Recently, we already launched the scenarios for for for Polkadot and Kusama staking mechanism that's it's been a months ago and accumulating much of liquidity for for much of the derivative device use cases in the ecosystem.
bifrost_finance:  And uh, today we're talking about, you know, the Bifrost and moonbeams use cases that so, so much of the focusing on the axiom usage is, you know, between.
bifrost_finance:  Adopt some or parish in and the EVM compatible PARACHIN and is.
bifrost_finance:  Evm protocols actually, so we which among some of experimental.
bifrost_finance:  Examples and the testing and some of others have been pushed to the production. So I think the first one and then you introduce is that we are actually promoting the cross channel staking for the collators for the staking mechanism. So which is a we are launching the first ever power chain staking derivative for Moon River and Moonbeam ecosystem.
bifrost_finance:  But initializing and utilizing the cross chain axiom delegating to the power potion calculators, so burning the stakes features PowerShell native token with D5 feature.
bifrost_finance:  And I think this, uh, this this is the first one I will introduce with you.
bifrost_finance:  The second one is adding the previous uh point I just mentioned about uh we are actually deploying around the ACM crossing governance by by using the PowerShell Native token disruptive, which means we can remote. We are pushing around around remotely executing the governance on the powertrain to the other one. So this is actually under the experimental stage.
bifrost_finance:  And which means the function while leaving the governance feature for the state interrupted.
bifrost_finance:  Um, and assert one is we are actually expanding the default axiom utilization use cases with.
bifrost_finance:  Then default protocols and creating remotely axiom function calling for cross chain swap liquidation and drop to maintain and interactions and so on. So interacting with Mombin currently in the production we have launched as I said the the the staking disruptive of for Moonbeam and and and and Moon River ecosystem and and they remotely.
bifrost_finance:  Calling for the governance function and the calling for Eva Smart contract functions around the DEFI use cases are still in the experimental stage. So I think that's that's what we recently researching and developing about. Thanks everyone.
bifrost_finance:  
bifrost_finance:  
KevinKNeilson:  Thank you so much, Tyrone. Well said. So my name is Kevin Nielsen. I'm a developer relations engineer at Moonbeam and thank you so much for having me here on the polka dot community call. So as you may know, Moonbeam is a platform for cross chain connected applications that unites functionality and assets from across many different blockchains and moonbeams. Connectivity to other chains is enabled by XCM within polka dot and we're also focused on connecting to other ecosystems.
KevinKNeilson:  Outside of Polkadot such as Etherium, Avalanche and others, and that connectivity is enabled by integrations with general message passing providers, also known as GMP Protocols. That includes ones like axillar, wormhole, layer 0, hyperlane, and others.
KevinKNeilson:  So, as Tyrone was saying, Moonbeam opened up XM channels with Bifrost. In addition to bringing the the Bifrost native token to Moonbeam as XBMC, you can now use that in DEFI and various applications. Glimmer is also available on by Frost, and Frost has created this V Glimmer token which represents staked Glimmer on Moonbeam, and then you can use that V glimmer in a variety of different applications.
KevinKNeilson:  One important distinction between V Glimmer and Glimmer is that the reserve chain for V Glimmer is by frost, not moonbeam. So this means that V Glimmer originates and depends upon by frost. So if we wanted to transfer V glimmer back to me beam, it will just need to be added as an external X20 and approved by democracy.
KevinKNeilson:  In order for it to go to Moonbeam as V Glimmer.
KevinKNeilson:  So we're extremely proud of this collaboration with by Frost and definitely think that it demonstrates the power of application specific chains working in conjunction with XM and I do have a couple more XM related topics to discuss today.
KevinKNeilson:  Part of that is the XML SDK, so many of them introduced in XML SDK within the last month, a month or two, and this enables developers to integrate into their applications the ability to deposit and withdraw assets to Moonbeam, Moon River and also to and from other para chains in the ecosystem. So.
KevinKNeilson:  And as well as from the relay chain. And in this case you don't need to worry about the intricacies of XCM. You don't have to build a a multilocation structure.
KevinKNeilson:  Instead, you just have to identify the asset they'd like to work with, and then the origin or the destination chain, and then the sending accounts signer. So if you're sending for a moonbeam, you would use ethers JS. If you're sending from the relay chain or another pair of chain, then you would most likely use polka dot JS as your signer. And. So this XML SDK includes functions you know depositing, withdrawing and initiation ones and and things like that you can subscribe to.
KevinKNeilson:  Changes in a users X asset balances and we have many different pair chain assets.
KevinKNeilson:  Compare chains that are that are listed within the ECM SDK and it's all open source and so A-Team can add their information and get supported very easily.
KevinKNeilson:  And last but last but certainly not least, I want to mention the illuminate hackathon. So this is one of the largest and the most ambitious hackathons that we've run to date, because it includes some of the largest players in the GMP protocol space, including Axillar, hyperlane, Layer zero and wormhole.
KevinKNeilson:  So the bounties are focused around building a connected contract use case using Moonbeam and the respective GMP protocol. They're not very prescriptive, so they're, they're quite open-ended. You can do just about anything you want. There are broad open categories, so there are things like.
KevinKNeilson:  Using a connected contract use case.
KevinKNeilson:  Regarding D Phi, governance, most creative use cases, et cetera, and.
KevinKNeilson:  If you haven't tested out, you know connected contracts yet, I highly encourage you to to check it out. Jeremy from the Moonbeam team has built a series of blog posts which are great tutorials for everything you need to know to get started. And typically in these blog posts you'll send a message from Moonbeam to another chain and you'll say like Hello World. But you'll learn exactly how the different GMP protocols work, and you'll see that they're they're not intimidating. They're quite easy, yo
KevinKNeilson:  And this hackathon is not a competition, you know, between the various GMP protocols. Rather it's a a collaborative exhibition and a showcase of, you know, all the different GMP protocols you know that are integrated with Moonbeam and.
KevinKNeilson:  On the hackathon, you know you can choose one, you can choose multiple bounties, you can have you know your application working with different GMP protocols, and that's what a prime protocol is doing. And they recently demoed their test net at illuminate, so I highly recommend checking out the prime protocol.
KevinKNeilson:  So I think that wraps it up for for Moonbeam. Moonbeam updates for today. Thanks again for having us.
Polkadot:  Excellent. Thank you so much for joining and thank you to all of our speakers that joined today. So those that may be tuned in late, you can also listen to the recording. It will be made available directly after the end of this call for 30 days on Twitter and indefinitely on Polka dots YouTube channel. And so for those that are just tuned in today, we heard from.
Polkadot:  Raul Polkadot, Council member who gave an update of all the governance motions and proposals for all of for both polka dot and Kusama this past month. We heard from Darwinian network and their light client based ETH 2.0 substrate cross chain bridge and we heard from equilibrium and they're closed beta. And what's next? We heard from Origin Trail and their project magnify and even what's next for Origin Trail?
Polkadot:  We heard from turn and light clients in the future of trustless bridging. We heard from Zoe about the polka dot events bounty, and we heard from Bifrost and Moonbeam about their axiom integration, and also moonbeam about the Ignite hackathon or no illuminate illuminate hackathon happening right now. So make sure to check all of those out. They'll also be a tweet thread recapping this space with all relevant links for you guys and.
Polkadot:  Next actually tomorrow, because this month was such a loaded month and our ecosystem is busy every month with a bunch of updates, we needed to have two community calls this month due to the amount of speakers and updates. So tomorrow at let me just confirm the time here really quick tomorrow from 4:00 to 5:00 PM CEST. So one hour before this we will also hear from a sub wallet from Pokedex from.
Polkadot:  Polkadot naming systems, name system, uh, Cross network, a star and Xfinity with also their updates. So make sure to set a reminder for that and join tomorrow. If not, catch the recap. And thank you to all of our speakers that tuned in today. All of them are very busy people and we appreciate you taking the time to come and update the polka dot community on all the amazing things that you guys are working on. So we'll see you all tomorrow.
Polkadot:  And thank you for tuning in.
Maciej_Baj:  Because you think you.
TomazOT:  
DrevZiga:  Thank you. Appreciate it.
bifrost_finance:  Pleasure.
Maciej_Baj:  
TomazOT:  Another day away.
Polkadot:  Hello everyone. Just give us another minute or two to get all the speakers added and then we will begin.
Polkadot:  All right, everyone, welcome to the November community call. All of our speakers are almost all of our speakers, excuse me, have joined us. We have a loaded.
KevinKNeilson:  We can hear you. Yeah, you're good.
hello_melikhov:  We.
Polkadot:  I just heard that no one can hear me. Is there? Can anyone confirm? Oh, you can hear me. OK, OK, wonderful. Great. So we have a packed agenda for agenda for us here today.
Polkadot:  To kick us off we will have Raul and at the polka dot Council member give a high level update of all the major referenda and motions and governance proposals we've had this past month on both networks for both polka dot and Kusama. We we will have Darwinia joining us today to talk about their first light client based E substrate cross chain asset bridge. We will have equilibrium joining us here today.
Polkadot:  To talk about their closed beta and what's next for equilibrium, we have Origin trail on the call with us today to talk about their project magnify. We have turn joining us to talk about light clients and the future of trustless bridging. So definitely you see a pattern here with light clients and bridging today we have an Ambassador Zoe joining us here today to talk about the polka dot events bounty and how you can use it and we have.
nachortti:  
Polkadot:  Frost and Moonbeam joining us together to talk about their axiom integration and the derivatives they're launching on Moonbeam. So or actually on Moonbeam, Moonbeam and Bifrost, excuse me. So without further ado, since we have such a jam packed agenda, let's kick it off with Rahul. I also want to remind everyone here in the lower right hand corner since the agenda will be packed today, there won't be time at the end probably to take questions. So if you have.
Polkadot:  Questions while the speakers are speaking, do hit this box or purple circle thing on the lower right hand corner and put your questions there and I will be checking as speakers are talking and make sure to ask your questions before they leave the stage, so to speak. So without further ado, let's hand it over to Raul.
nachortti:  Hi everyone, I hope you can hear me OK.
nachortti:  Yes.
Polkadot:  Yes, we can hear you.
zoemcfox:  Yes.
nachortti:  Because I was having some issues. I'm sorry. So good day to everyone. I hope you're having a good day. I'm here to give you the latest changes on proposals on both Kusama and Polka dot network. As always, I will start by Kusama then move to Polkadot and I will divide each network on governance proposals and treasury proposals. So let's start with Kusama first. On Kusama we have quite the month because referendum 244 which was already executed.
nachortti:  Upgraded the runtime, the network runtime, to version 9320. This upgrade included open governance, which is the new model for governance that we're experimenting with on Kusama before moving on to Polkadot. And there's still some adjustments to be done, especially on some of the parameters for each of the tracks that the community can now propose proposals on and both simultaneously, and some other adjustments.
nachortti:  Regarding some issues with migrations, particularly with two ex with two approved proposals that came from as a legacy from governance 11 from Genshiro, one from Kintsugi, which the Council will be voted on soon to make sure that they get executed as the Community wanted. But other than that, open governance seems to be working quite nicely and we need to adjust some things, so congratulations to everyone who participated.
nachortti:  And the referendum 244 boat.
nachortti:  On other news, there is a there is some updates on the statement COLLATORS set up. Motion 577 which was executed reduce the Collators managed by the statement team from four to two and increase the public collators from 4 to 8. And then a follow up motion motion 580 which was also executed also further increased the statement public collators from 8 to 12. So this means that.
nachortti:  Now public collators can also participate on the state my network collation referendum 243 which was also executed extended encounters common good list for a 48 more weeks. So congratulations to the team for that and thank you to the Community for voting in this particular proposal regarding treasury proposals on kosama motion 573, which was also approved by the Council.
nachortti:  Funded the development of CUSA Mint. Cusa Mint is a development kit for NFTR artists, collection makers and the Kusama community in general. It provides different tools to mint and manage NFT's with ease. So congratulations to the team and we're looking forward to the first deliverables and how to use them. There's also an external motion that was approved by the Council and will be put up for vote by the Community soon as a legacy of governance.
nachortti:  One, this is the Treasury proposal 227 for Kagome C++ implementation, the Kagome C++.
nachortti:  Implementation aims at the team aims to to cover the first milestone development of Kagome, which is a polka dot host greeting in SIM plus plus and developed by Sora Mitsu. It will be up for a vote by the community soon on the democracy tab under the governance one model since it's an external cue, so we will announce it on the direction channel so the Community can vote for the normal period of time on Kusama. The goal of the proposal is to complete the client integration on the pole Karan Kusa
nachortti:  That will make us validating nodes. So we're looking forward to that boat as well. And then as the last one on Treasury proposals on Kusama, we're excited to say that referendum #1, which is the first Treasury proposal up for vote on the open governance model is now up for both by the Community. This is a Treasury proposal for the Snow Bridge funding development. Snow Bridge is a a fully trustless, permissionless and general purpose bridge between.
nachortti:  Some polka dot and etherium the rich will launch as we know on the bridge have a common good para chain that is being developed by parity and this proposal is a funding request for 28 months worth of the long term runway for all operations. For the Snow Bridge team, the full proposal can be reviewed on the post. We're going to share all of these links also on Twitter, but you can also find the links and the discussions in the direction channel or in the governance forums as well.
nachortti:  Let's move to Polkadot Polkadot. We have also quite a few governance proposals, the first one being referendum 81 which was executed by executed, approved and executed by the community. The referendum 81 includes Polkadot collectives common good para chain proposal on a lease on polka dot network. So now the collective common good chain is up and running and building blocks and the first two the 1st.
nachortti:  The collective that we will see happening on the collective spirit and will probably be the Polkadot alliance which you will be able to find the links also in the tweets once we provide all of the information. But you can also find the discussion on poke assembly and eventually I think the fellowship will also migrate to to polka dot ones. This is ready and regarding the the next proposals and referendum 78.
nachortti:  Was also passed and executed. This is the first Polkadot nomination pool initial configuration. The initial configuration for this nomination polls that were added on POLKADOT includes the following one dot to join a pool, 200 dots to create a pool, and a maximum of 64 pools and 16,000 members in all polls. So we're very excited about this new feature that the staking team has been.
nachortti:  Working on for quite some time, so super excited for more small token holders to join and participate in the shared security of the network related to the new configuration of nomination polls. There was a second proposal that was voted as that is being voted as referendum 86 and it will be up for vote for the next 20 days. This proposal tries to increase the minimum nomination limits for.
nachortti:  Uh, nominators. In order to prevent too many waiting nominators to be created and incentivize small nominators to move to nomination polls, you can still vote on this proposal. It's up for a vote right now on Polkadot for the next 20 days as a referendum #86 and then a motion to 191 was also passed by the Council. This was not voted by the community as it was not necessary for the Community to vote the Council.
nachortti:  Voted on this one and this includes a proposal for open permissionless Collado registration and statement. So this includes public collators on statement in the same way as they are included on statement. Following on our experience in Kusama network regarding Treasury proposals, we have three that I want to point out and make sure that everyone knows about them. The first one is referendum 77, which was passed.
nachortti:  As we know for the gossamer ongoing development grant, we've been talking about this in the other Community calls when the proposal was up for discussion. Gossamer is a polka dot host greeting lingo, and it's a framework to build and run nose for different blockchain protocols compatible with the polka dot ecosystem. And the overall goal is to provide the functionality needed to bring true client diversity to the polka dot ecosystem. So this particular contextual information can be seen also in 
nachortti:  Has referendum 77 already passed by the community? Then we have motion 298 that is also up for both and related to the Snow Bridge proposal that is on Kusama as well. Although the Snow Bridge proposal on Kusama is an open Gov model, meaning that the community is already voting on it on polka dot, we still have governance one model. This means that this proposal, given their requested allocation, is up for vote by the Council as an external motion.
nachortti:  And then we'll be boarded by the community if the Council approves. This is the portion of the Snow Bridge proposal that needs to be funded by the Polkadot Treasury. A portion of it will be funded by the Kusama Treasury and a portion by Polka dot Network. And the third one I want to point out as a Treasury proposal that is interest interesting to the Community and pass this week is Motion 296 already passed by the Council and executed. This is a proposal for ink design.
nachortti:  Audit by open settling open settling has developed a deep expertise and set industry standards for secure smart contract development in the past, and this is their first proposal on the polka dot network. This Community proposal because it involves open settling but also several teams in the polka dot ecosystem including a star big country, open brush pendulum network, falla network, water and others. This proposal aims to audit and review the current design.
nachortti:  The Ink smart contract language together with substrate mark contracts valid to recommend actions to be taken and improve the development experience and security of ink language. So All in all, those are the proposals that I'd like to point out to the Community. We're going to be sharing all of the links for the Open Golf model. We will also be sharing a link for your suggestions and request a of changes in the Opengov model so we can discuss them and eventually open the discussion and vote for 
DarwiniaAMAs:  
Polkadot:  Thank you, Raul. And as Rahul mentioned, I know that was a lot and a bunch of links and a bunch of information really fast. So after this Twitter space tomorrow, we typically tweet out a tweet thread with all of these relevant links to all of these proposals. So if you heard something and you wonder where is that located or what's the link, we will be posting that tomorrow. So without further ado, up next we have Darwinia network to talk about their first light client based.
DarwiniaAMAs:  
Polkadot:  Ethereum 2.0 substrate, cross chain message route and Bridge Asset Bridge.
DarwiniaAMAs:  So that's a bit of a handful I guess, um, GM and GM everyone. I hope you're having a great day or evening wherever you are. For those of you who aren't aware, Darwinia is a programmable cross chain message network and one of only a few number of substrate native projects working on trustless light client based bridges between polka dot and external networks. And it's a super exciting time for trustless bridges in the ecosystem, especially as we get closer to the launch of the BV finality gadget 
DarwiniaAMAs:  Rachel, further decentralize things and uh in the meantime, at Darwinia we've recently deployed the first light client based Etherium 2.0 to substrate route and Helix Bridge has incorporated it for use between Etherium and Darwinian network for a select few assets. Next, we're going to be extending the route for use with power chains and projects we've opened channels with which will allow developers on those chains to call smart contracts on Ethereum using Axiom and vice versa using Darwinian a
DarwiniaAMAs:  SDK which will allow developers to address simple, simple endpoints from a single smart contract deployment. Overall interest in trusses, bridges and interoperability and our integration queue is growing fast these days, so if you need to incorporate functionality or assets from external chains and security is a primary consideration, definitely feel free to reach out for more info.
DarwiniaAMAs:  
Polkadot:  Great. Thank you so much. Is that it on your side, Megan?
Polkadot:  
DarwiniaAMAs:  That's all the updates we have for now. Thank you.
Polkadot:  OK, wonderful. Well then let's hand it over to equilibrium to talk about they just recently closed beta and let's hear what's next for equilibrium.
hello_melikhov:  Yeah. Thanks very much. Thanks very much for having me here. I'm super excited to join today's call and share some perspective on our road map, what we doing, it's equilibrium and what we have accomplished just recently. You mentioned the closed beta, we had great success with that. But firstly, before I go into details of all these things, let me briefly introduce myself, give you some context in what we're exactly building in the Dotsam ecosystem. So my name is Alex, I'm the CEO and the founde
hello_melikhov:  It's, uh, equilibrium. I'm engineered by mathematics but training and I'm actually in crypto since.
hello_melikhov:  For quite a long period of time since 2016. We've been working on equilibrium since 2020. So it's been 2.5 years almost of extensive building. And the idea behind equilibrium is the building the comprehensive D5 platform, which includes a bunch of functionality starting from.
hello_melikhov:  The like little functions with working with the ecosystem tokens and.
hello_melikhov:  Actually, like it's one of the most the broadest, I guess functionality that we have across D5.
hello_melikhov:  Platforms in the, in the in the markets overall, so.
hello_melikhov:  Recently we have conducted the closed beta launch and we we actually been, we have our own parachin slot that we have got back in the days and in April and it's been a long journey for us to roll out our developments into real production. So recently I was actually in October we will we were conducting the closed beta launch for for limited group of users.
hello_melikhov:  Uh, but uh, the activity that we have seen was really impressive. We have.
hello_melikhov:  First of all, we have launched the subscription for closed beta participation and we have received over 10,000 applications. Out of this 10,000 applicants, we have chosen roughly 4048 hundreds of users who were accepted for the closed beats and we have seen quite significant activity around our products that have been running for the closed pizza. The idea of the closed pizza was to.
hello_melikhov:  Lets people play with the virtual tokens on our side. So so they got. They received like everyone who stayed in the closed beats they received.
hello_melikhov:  Um, certain kind of amounts of these virtual assets and they needed to play with these assets in the course of the closed beta, obviously. So it was completely risk free. And there was also a team competition. So we have got so 23 teams participating in that. All the teams were kind of other representing certain communityinthe.com ecosystem or ecosystem projects. It was super, super interesting to see.
hello_melikhov:  Our guys were competing for like rewards that we were putting out in terms of these closed beta launch, given that.
hello_melikhov:  You know we have seen that's.
hello_melikhov:  CBT around our closed launch, we're expecting that we'll actually replicate this success in terms of our full scale launch, which will expectedly happen in the first half of this. So right now we are extensively preparing for that. And yeah, so if you're interested in our developments, you can actually visit our website, it's equilibrium dot IO. There we have all the links to soft pools where you can see like.
hello_melikhov:  So their announcements and our production launch, we're super excited about that. Again, it was a long journey. Just recently we have in terms of preparations for this production launch, we have also integrated with the multi chain bridge which is connected to us through Moonbeam. This is really important development for us because we can smoothly and almost.
hello_melikhov:  Kind of. In decentralized we transfer assets from other blockchains into equilibrium and.
hello_melikhov:  Uh, what's also importance on our side we have we will be opening axiom connections with all the operation projects we have partnership relations with, including Moonbeam Astar.
hello_melikhov:  And um, insulate and many others. So eventually we'll be establishing like exempt transfers across the polka dot ecosystem and eventually integrating all this kind of.
hello_melikhov:  Essence that we get through this transfers into our products that we are rolling out.
hello_melikhov:  Yes. So I guess pretty much from my side. Thank you very much for having me.
hello_melikhov:  
Polkadot:  Wonderful. Thanks, Alex. And up next we have Origin Trail to talk about project magnify.
DrevZiga:  Hello from our side this time it's two people from Origin trail, both myself, giga and stomach from from origin trail as founders.
DrevZiga:  It's it's pleasure to be here I believe this is one of our first calls within within the Polkadot Polkadot Band and it's it's it's great to be here and share exciting updates about about Origin Trail just a little bit about the origin trail for those who don't know us we are an ecosystem dedicated to making global economy at large work sustainably by organizing humanity's most important assets and we deal extensively with the issue of of trust in in supply chains.
DrevZiga:  Trust generally in in global economy and trust essentially has two enemies it's bad character and also bad data or bad information. And as you have seen and witnessed right now with all these FDX debacles and and similar things and also within supply chains and global economy, we cannot eliminate the bad character but what we can tackle is essentially bad information. We can tackle bad data and this is this is something that origin trail is taking the.
DrevZiga:  That app and what we're essentially doing and how we're dealing with the problem of bad data is by harnessing the power of decentralized knowledge graph. And the centralized knowledge graph is a merge between two technologies, blockchain on one side and also the knowledge graph technology which is being used by the likes of Google to connect information, to organize information and make it discoverable, verifiable and valuable. So we took both elements and what we do, we bring supply chain.
DrevZiga:  Of documents, consumer goods, information, digital collectibles, whatever asset and we bring it on the decentralized knowledge graph, making it discoverable, verifiable as Web 3 assets and thus driving transparency and trust. And we've been around for a while now. Origin Trail as a Web 3 project has been up and running for for five years, and we're especially glad and proud to be able to.
DrevZiga:  Deploying our origin trail on on polka dot. It was previously deployed on several other chains but right now it has gotten its own origin trail specific chain, its own parrot chain. It has been live since since summer and right now not only we're launching 11 network this year which is which is Origin Trail para chain, but also the second network which is the decentralized Knowledge Graph V6.
DrevZiga:  And the decentralized Knowledge Graph V6 is going to primarily use polka dot to bring quite important traffic from global supply chains where we have been traditionally involved. One such example is, is a group of retailers from the US you might know some of them like Walmart, JCPenney, Costco, So what they have been using Origin Trail for, they were exchanging information about all the three reports on several actually.
DrevZiga:  And dozens of thousands of factories importing to the United States. So traffic like like this, assets like like those are going to transition from from other chains where origin trail has been based on up until recently, 2V6 which is primarily going to launch on on Polkadot and also launching on OT, para, chain on polka dot and effectively on on the DKG on the decentralized knowledge graph is a project magnified. Now what project magnified does it allows for?
DrevZiga:  Visualization of all the assets of all the information that has been created on the decentralized knowledge graph and it's very easy to use. Anybody can use it, not only companies that we have traditionally been working with. And you're all welcome to join our telegram or or discord and see what has been achieved so far. It's an entirely community driven project project magnify and it will essentially go live from from the.
DrevZiga:  Beta version in which it is currently on the fully fledged public launch sometimes in the in the beginning of of January and another exciting thing which is going to precede that and it's it's mostly I think the the Community of Origin 12 is eagerly waiting waiting for that is the V6 launch which which for which we are within this and the next week waiting for to to certainly determine the determine.
DrevZiga:  Then in December we can you know have have have this happy event of releasing the beast called the DGV 6 on on the polka dot. I would now invite to Marsh to add a few things about the origin trail in general or the project magnify. It was really lovely to to talk with you and we're glad to continue this conversation in one of our channels whenever you feel eager to join.
DrevZiga:  
TomazOT:  Yeah, I think you I think you did it did a great job already covering most of the topics. So not much left for me to accept it to say hi to everyone and then again maybe extend the invitation really with with project magnifier especially it's something that that's very much a collaborative effort currently it it, it is within the the closed beta group of the Origin Trail community that are already creating.
TomazOT:  Assets on the on on the current test net version of O V6 which will then transition to the main net and they're already creating value for the network as well as value for themselves. And as a project it's really directed towards the values of the core values of web three of trust of ownership and it introduces certain other business models to what we were used to so far within the tech industry so.
TomazOT:  Yeah like the the website for Project magnify will be project magnify dot IO so you can go there and check it out and hope to see you hope to bump into you into our in our discord or telegram. So yeah that's thanks thanks for today.
Polkadot:  Wonderful. Thank you. And if you guys haven't noticed yet, at the top of the screen here, for each speaker, we're penning the relevant tweets or links. So if anything is of interest to you or you're wanting to follow the project or learn more, you can just simply click on the tweet here and you won't even leave the community call and you can give them a follow you can.
Polkadot:  Like the tweet? You can read it For more information. So up next we also have a turn to talk about light clients in the future of trustless bridging.
Maciej_Baj:  Hi, everyone. Likely from time here. Yeah, thank you so much for having us today. Seems like we were fitting in perfectly in today's theme talking about like clients.
Maciej_Baj:  One is all about drinking interoperable execution with the first aspect to it and on our way to provide the.
Maciej_Baj:  Ohh, discharging this platform for multi chain execution, we've been developing and experimenting bunch with light clients and while doing so we also discovered that essentially we can just bring light clients on chain.
Maciej_Baj:  Distance a little bit into opposition to what we see currently, where light currents are usually the ocean agents are primarily because the computation on Chinese is very expensive on material also.
Maciej_Baj:  Clients need to store a significant amount of storage information and on most of the most of the blockchains there's also quite expensive. Also there's different signature schemes on different blockchain and usually while developing smart contracts you only have the cheap way of verifying a single signature scheme, but in substrate assuming that.
Maciej_Baj:  We already paid for a parking slot. The the storage is cheap.
Maciej_Baj:  And.
Maciej_Baj:  Really nothing stands on the way of bringing all the lines going on chain and this is what we've been developing and experimenting for now. For now we have a light client that is operating on Grandpa, but we've been also investigating and started all experiments with the kaspari ETHERIUM 2.0 light clients. And also in substrate we can just implement and easily access multiple different signature schemes. So snorkel.
Maciej_Baj:  Or different parts trains at workers for etherium like blockchains and CSA for Bitcoin like Bitcoin like projects. So this was just a sneak peek. There's gonna be a kind of more detailed rundown throughout bringing on the live clients on chain.
Maciej_Baj:  On our talk on sub zero, which if you have a chance to join at least one.
Maciej_Baj:  Yeah, it would be lovely to to see you guys in catch up, catch up in person.
Maciej_Baj:  Also little updates to.
Maciej_Baj:  To our turn testers on the Coco who finally put the.
Maciej_Baj:  Local parroting of turn back on track.
Maciej_Baj:  It got stuck the last week on the last runtime upgrade, but luckily we passed all of the all of the necessary issues and the update on the Rococo it was bringing bidding for the smart contracts and the first of execution. So essentially this last feature that we added, it goes hand in hand in the very much so like open.
Maciej_Baj:  System for first of execution when we provide the system where open executors can bid for the cheapest possible execution.
Maciej_Baj:  Of of transactions to the remote blockchains.
Maciej_Baj:  Uh.
Maciej_Baj:  So yeah, super happy to to join today's call and possibly look forward to see you guys and.
Maciej_Baj:  Hear from you on Sub zero event. Thank you.
Polkadot:  Wonderful. Thank you. Up next, we have Zoe to talk about the Polkadot events bounty.
zoemcfox:  Hello everyone. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I will now going from deep tech in tomorrow again like a governance talk here. I'm Zoe, I'm global head ambassador of events for the polka dot network and one of three Co radars for the events bounty which I would like to shortly introduce you to today to give you a bit of a background how this bounty was created. The events bounty got initiated within division of decentralizing the.
zoemcfox:  Dot Council, which means to actually create initiatives that focus on specific areas or have more expertise in specific areas. And as some of you guys also noticed or realized that there was a big increase of event submissions to the Treasury to request funding and to have also the Council deciding on what kind of events should be funded from the Treasury and this big workload or this was a big workload.
zoemcfox:  What a Council itself and also a challenge because it was sometimes difficult for the Council to decide what kind of events are actually valuable to the Community and which are beneficial for the overall popular brand. And this was the initial thought about creating, let's say, a smaller council, a council or a group that has more expertise in the events for the POLKADOT community. And this is how the events bounty got actually initiated.
zoemcfox:  We have. It is a community events reward bounty with child bounty distribution. This is also very special because it's the second bounty that is actually using the child bounty mechanism in the popular ecosystem besides the anti scam bound team.
zoemcfox:  And this bounty is life now since our active since three months we have received 1,000,000 dot and we have 3 curators in this events bound team which are on one inside LED. She's community manager of Web 3 foundation and she also leads the overall Polkadot ambassador program. So she's very close in knowing what kind of events and meetups are initiated or hosted by Poco dot ambassadors. And then there's.
zoemcfox:  Mark was also a global head ambassador for the overall events in Polkadot as well. Myself and Mark and I are leading these kind of events for the popular community. So we have besides the Council a bit of a better insight on what kind of events are beneficial to the Community and also know what kind of requirements should be actually met to execute and host successful events that overall represent the Polkadot brand and expand the Polkadot brand to everyone that wants to know about it.
zoemcfox:  We have three different categories. I don't want to go into this, to uh, into detail, but overall we are supporting on one hand side all ambassadors, people that have an ambassador status and they want to host meetups and smaller get togethers and we also have category.
zoemcfox:  At category that covers bigger events such as conferences, hackathons or side events. And these kind of events can be organised by any Community member, someone that has a relationship to Polkadot, even Powertrain team members. So we have created a process that makes it much easier for or let's say Lena for the for the people to actually apply for funding. But it doesn't mean that we have less requirements. So we are still pretty strict in seeing what kind of requirements this event.
zoemcfox:  That meat to actually be supported in funding from in, in dot and from the Treasury. So over there to just give you a bit of overview here, over the last three months we have funded over 20 events which is a combination of bit of conferences as well as meetups and side events also now for sub zero that's coming up, there were a lot of submissions to fund these kind of of side events and we have also public page where you can actually look into this but if you would like to learn.
zoemcfox:  More about how this bounty works, how you as a powertrain team member, as a popular ambassador or just the active community member can request funding and rewards for doing activities such as events for the ecosystem. I would encourage you to join our crowdcast event which we are hosting on the 8th of December. It will be hosted on Polka dots official crowdcast platform and in this session we are going much more into detail how this whole bounce bounce.
zoemcfox:  Mechanism is working from a technical perspective but also to give you more insights on how you can actually go through the process to get funding for events. But we also cover other child boundaries such as the anti scam bounty and moderation bounty. So thank you so much and I look forward to see a lot of you guys on crowdcast and answer more of your questions there.
Polkadot:  Thank you so much Zoe, and again yes, if you guys have more questions, make sure to attend that crowd cast on December 8th on polka dots crowdcast. So last but certainly, certainly not least, we have a by frost and Moonbeam here to talk about their XCM integration.
KevinKNeilson:  High for us. Do you want to kick it off?
bifrost_finance:  Yep, no problem. Thanks.
bifrost_finance:  Greetings everyone, and this is Tyrone from Bifrost. I'm the product manager of Bifrost and we're very happy to be here today.
bifrost_finance:  Both was actually originally focusing on the building of cross chain staking Syrios and the liquid utilization for staking their options.
bifrost_finance:  And Martha's is actually deployed on Polkadot and Kusama para chain, but it actually running the same architecture, native token and business model. So which will be merged to one power share by using substrate common bridge in the future and which is also the direction that we are presently evaluating and researching about it and.
bifrost_finance:  Recently, we already launched the scenarios for for for Polkadot and Kusama staking mechanism that's it's been a months ago and accumulating much of liquidity for for much of the derivative device use cases in the ecosystem.
bifrost_finance:  And uh, today we're talking about, you know, the Bifrost and moonbeams use cases that so, so much of the focusing on the axiom usage is, you know, between.
bifrost_finance:  Adopt some or parish in and the EVM compatible PARACHIN and is.
bifrost_finance:  Evm protocols actually, so we which among some of experimental.
bifrost_finance:  Examples and the testing and some of others have been pushed to the production. So I think the first one and then you introduce is that we are actually promoting the cross channel staking for the collators for the staking mechanism. So which is a we are launching the first ever power chain staking derivative for Moon River and Moonbeam ecosystem.
bifrost_finance:  But initializing and utilizing the cross chain axiom delegating to the power potion calculators, so burning the stakes features PowerShell native token with D5 feature.
bifrost_finance:  And I think this, uh, this this is the first one I will introduce with you.
bifrost_finance:  The second one is adding the previous uh point I just mentioned about uh we are actually deploying around the ACM crossing governance by by using the PowerShell Native token disruptive, which means we can remote. We are pushing around around remotely executing the governance on the powertrain to the other one. So this is actually under the experimental stage.
bifrost_finance:  And which means the function while leaving the governance feature for the state interrupted.
bifrost_finance:  Um, and assert one is we are actually expanding the default axiom utilization use cases with.
bifrost_finance:  Then default protocols and creating remotely axiom function calling for cross chain swap liquidation and drop to maintain and interactions and so on. So interacting with Mombin currently in the production we have launched as I said the the the staking disruptive of for Moonbeam and and and and Moon River ecosystem and and they remotely.
bifrost_finance:  Calling for the governance function and the calling for Eva Smart contract functions around the DEFI use cases are still in the experimental stage. So I think that's that's what we recently researching and developing about. Thanks everyone.
bifrost_finance:  
bifrost_finance:  
KevinKNeilson:  Thank you so much, Tyrone. Well said. So my name is Kevin Nielsen. I'm a developer relations engineer at Moonbeam and thank you so much for having me here on the polka dot community call. So as you may know, Moonbeam is a platform for cross chain connected applications that unites functionality and assets from across many different blockchains and moonbeams. Connectivity to other chains is enabled by XCM within polka dot and we're also focused on connecting to other ecosystems.
KevinKNeilson:  Outside of Polkadot such as Etherium, Avalanche and others, and that connectivity is enabled by integrations with general message passing providers, also known as GMP Protocols. That includes ones like axillar, wormhole, layer 0, hyperlane, and others.
KevinKNeilson:  So, as Tyrone was saying, Moonbeam opened up XM channels with Bifrost. In addition to bringing the the Bifrost native token to Moonbeam as XBMC, you can now use that in DEFI and various applications. Glimmer is also available on by Frost, and Frost has created this V Glimmer token which represents staked Glimmer on Moonbeam, and then you can use that V glimmer in a variety of different applications.
KevinKNeilson:  One important distinction between V Glimmer and Glimmer is that the reserve chain for V Glimmer is by frost, not moonbeam. So this means that V Glimmer originates and depends upon by frost. So if we wanted to transfer V glimmer back to me beam, it will just need to be added as an external X20 and approved by democracy.
KevinKNeilson:  In order for it to go to Moonbeam as V Glimmer.
KevinKNeilson:  So we're extremely proud of this collaboration with by Frost and definitely think that it demonstrates the power of application specific chains working in conjunction with XM and I do have a couple more XM related topics to discuss today.
KevinKNeilson:  Part of that is the XML SDK, so many of them introduced in XML SDK within the last month, a month or two, and this enables developers to integrate into their applications the ability to deposit and withdraw assets to Moonbeam, Moon River and also to and from other para chains in the ecosystem. So.
KevinKNeilson:  And as well as from the relay chain. And in this case you don't need to worry about the intricacies of XCM. You don't have to build a a multilocation structure.
KevinKNeilson:  Instead, you just have to identify the asset they'd like to work with, and then the origin or the destination chain, and then the sending accounts signer. So if you're sending for a moonbeam, you would use ethers JS. If you're sending from the relay chain or another pair of chain, then you would most likely use polka dot JS as your signer. And. So this XML SDK includes functions you know depositing, withdrawing and initiation ones and and things like that you can subscribe to.
KevinKNeilson:  Changes in a users X asset balances and we have many different pair chain assets.
KevinKNeilson:  Compare chains that are that are listed within the ECM SDK and it's all open source and so A-Team can add their information and get supported very easily.
KevinKNeilson:  And last but last but certainly not least, I want to mention the illuminate hackathon. So this is one of the largest and the most ambitious hackathons that we've run to date, because it includes some of the largest players in the GMP protocol space, including Axillar, hyperlane, Layer zero and wormhole.
KevinKNeilson:  So the bounties are focused around building a connected contract use case using Moonbeam and the respective GMP protocol. They're not very prescriptive, so they're, they're quite open-ended. You can do just about anything you want. There are broad open categories, so there are things like.
KevinKNeilson:  Using a connected contract use case.
KevinKNeilson:  Regarding D Phi, governance, most creative use cases, et cetera, and.
KevinKNeilson:  If you haven't tested out, you know connected contracts yet, I highly encourage you to to check it out. Jeremy from the Moonbeam team has built a series of blog posts which are great tutorials for everything you need to know to get started. And typically in these blog posts you'll send a message from Moonbeam to another chain and you'll say like Hello World. But you'll learn exactly how the different GMP protocols work, and you'll see that they're they're not intimidating. They're quite easy, yo
KevinKNeilson:  And this hackathon is not a competition, you know, between the various GMP protocols. Rather it's a a collaborative exhibition and a showcase of, you know, all the different GMP protocols you know that are integrated with Moonbeam and.
KevinKNeilson:  On the hackathon, you know you can choose one, you can choose multiple bounties, you can have you know your application working with different GMP protocols, and that's what a prime protocol is doing. And they recently demoed their test net at illuminate, so I highly recommend checking out the prime protocol.
KevinKNeilson:  So I think that wraps it up for for Moonbeam. Moonbeam updates for today. Thanks again for having us.
Polkadot:  Excellent. Thank you so much for joining and thank you to all of our speakers that joined today. So those that may be tuned in late, you can also listen to the recording. It will be made available directly after the end of this call for 30 days on Twitter and indefinitely on Polka dots YouTube channel. And so for those that are just tuned in today, we heard from.
Polkadot:  Raul Polkadot, Council member who gave an update of all the governance motions and proposals for all of for both polka dot and Kusama this past month. We heard from Darwinian network and their light client based ETH 2.0 substrate cross chain bridge and we heard from equilibrium and they're closed beta. And what's next? We heard from Origin Trail and their project magnify and even what's next for Origin Trail?
Polkadot:  We heard from turn and light clients in the future of trustless bridging. We heard from Zoe about the polka dot events bounty, and we heard from Bifrost and Moonbeam about their axiom integration, and also moonbeam about the Ignite hackathon or no illuminate illuminate hackathon happening right now. So make sure to check all of those out. They'll also be a tweet thread recapping this space with all relevant links for you guys and.
Polkadot:  Next actually tomorrow, because this month was such a loaded month and our ecosystem is busy every month with a bunch of updates, we needed to have two community calls this month due to the amount of speakers and updates. So tomorrow at let me just confirm the time here really quick tomorrow from 4:00 to 5:00 PM CEST. So one hour before this we will also hear from a sub wallet from Pokedex from.
Polkadot:  Polkadot naming systems, name system, uh, Cross network, a star and Xfinity with also their updates. So make sure to set a reminder for that and join tomorrow. If not, catch the recap. And thank you to all of our speakers that tuned in today. All of them are very busy people and we appreciate you taking the time to come and update the polka dot community on all the amazing things that you guys are working on. So we'll see you all tomorrow.
Polkadot:  And thank you for tuning in.
Maciej_Baj:  Because you think you.
TomazOT:  
DrevZiga:  Thank you. Appreciate it.
bifrost_finance:  Pleasure.
Maciej_Baj:  
TomazOT:  Another day away.
